# SixteenPointsScripts
Scripts associated to the article *"Sixteen points in $\mbp^4$ and the inverse Galois problem for del Pezzo surfaces of degree one"*. The article can be found at **link**. 

To run the script associated to the enumeration of Brauer groups, input into a Magma session:
```
load "brauer.m";
Main();
```

To run the script to verify the example curve is nonsingular, input into a Magma session:
